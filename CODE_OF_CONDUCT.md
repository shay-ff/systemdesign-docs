## Educational Focus

- **Mistakes are treated as learning opportunities** rather than failures

### Technical Discussions

When engaging in technical discussions:

- **Explain your reasoning** - help others understand your thought process
- **Provide context** - consider the audience's experience level
- **Offer alternatives** - show different approaches to solving problems
- **Cite sources** - reference authoritative materials when possible
- **Admit uncertainty** - it's okay to say "I don't know" or "I'm not sure"

## Community Values

We welcome contributors and learners from all backgrounds, including:

- **Students and new graduates** starting their system design journey
