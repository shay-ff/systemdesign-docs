# Foundations — core ideas for system design

This folder contains short, focused notes that form the mental model you should carry into any system design discussion.

What you'll find here:
- `concepts.md` — the essential HLD and LLD concepts explained with short analogies and diagrams.
- `cheatsheet.md` — quick rules of thumb and back-of-the-envelope formulas.
- `design-patterns.md` — common architectural and reliability patterns with when-to-use guidance.
- `glossary.md` — concise definitions you can memorize for interviews.
- `faqs.md` — pragmatic answers to questions students frequently ask.

Read `concepts.md` first, then use `cheatsheet.md` when solving sizing or trade-off questions.

Small exercises: pick any two glossary terms and explain them to a friend in one sentence each.
