### 3. Mock Interview Practice (1 hour each)
Use realistic scenarios from **[mock-interviews/](mock-interviews/)**:
- Time yourself (45-60 minutes per session)
- Practice drawing on whiteboard/paper
- Record yourself explaining the design
- Use evaluation rubrics for self-assessment

### 4. Quick Review (15 minutes daily)
- Review **[flashcards](flashcards.json)** during commute
- Memorize key numbers from **[cheat sheet](../00-foundations/cheatsheet.md)**
- Practice drawing common patterns from memory

## 💡 Interview Tips & Strategies

### Before the Interview
- **Research the Company** — Understand their scale and technical challenges
- **Practice Drawing** — Use whiteboard or paper, not digital tools
- **Prepare Questions** — Have thoughtful questions about their systems
- **Review Recent Work** — Be ready to discuss your system design experience

### During the Interview
- **Start with Clarification** — Always ask questions before designing
- **Think Out Loud** — Explain your reasoning as you work
- **Start Simple** — Begin with basic design, then add complexity
- **Draw First** — Visual diagrams help both you and the interviewer
- **Discuss Trade-offs** — Show you understand different approaches

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Jumping to Solution** — Not clarifying requirements first
- **Over-Engineering** — Adding unnecessary complexity early
- **Ignoring Scale** — Not considering performance and capacity
- **Poor Communication** — Not explaining thought process clearly
- **Rigid Thinking** — Not adapting when interviewer provides feedback
