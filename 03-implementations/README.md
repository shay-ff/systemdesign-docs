## 🔄 Integration with Learning Path

### Connection to Theory
Each implementation demonstrates concepts from:
- **[Foundations](../00-foundations/README.md)**: Scalability, caching, consistency patterns
- **[Low-Level Designs](../01-ll-designs/README.md)**: Data structures and algorithms in practice
- **[High-Level Designs](../02-hl-designs/README.md)**: System architecture patterns

### Real-World Applications
- **Cache Server** → Used in [Netflix](../02-hl-designs/netflix_streaming/README.md), [Twitter](../02-hl-designs/twitter_clone/README.md) designs
- **Rate Limiter** → Essential for [API gateways](../02-hl-designs/uber_system/README.md) and [user-facing services](../02-hl-designs/url_shortener/README.md)
- **Message Broker** → Core component in [event-driven architectures](../02-hl-designs/uber_system/README.md)
- **Distributed Lock** → Coordination primitive for [distributed systems](../02-hl-designs/youtube/README.md)

## 📊 Performance & Monitoring

### Benchmarking
Each service includes performance testing:
```bash
# Cache Server
cd cache-server/benchmarks/
python benchmark.py

# Rate Limiter Service  
cd rate-limiter-service/load-test/
python load_test.py

# Message Broker
cd simple-message-broker/load-test/
go run load_test.go
```

### Monitoring
Services include:
- **Prometheus Metrics** — Performance and business metrics
- **Health Endpoints** — Service status and dependencies
- **Structured Logging** — JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Grafana Dashboards** — Visual monitoring (where applicable)

## 🛠️ Development & Customization

### Local Development
```bash
# Start dependencies only
docker-compose up redis  # or other dependencies

# Run service locally for development
# (Check individual service README for specific commands)
```

### Configuration
Services use environment variables for configuration:
- **Database connections** — Redis, PostgreSQL endpoints
- **Service parameters** — Cache size, rate limits, timeouts
- **Feature flags** — Enable/disable specific features
